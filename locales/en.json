    "historyTitle": "The Interesting History of the Lottery",
    "historyP1": "Though it may seem like a simple number game, the lottery has a long tradition that dates back through human history. The origins of the lottery can be traced to ancient civilizations.",
    "historyH2_1": "Early Forms in Ancient Rome and China",
    "historyP2": "The first records of a lottery-like game can be found in the Han Dynasty of ancient China. It is said that around 200 B.C., a keno-like drawing was issued to raise funds for major state projects, such as the construction of the Great Wall.",
    "historyP3": "In ancient Rome, emperors would give out 'apophoreta,' a type of prize ticket, to guests at banquets. Wealthy citizens would donate funds, and prizes like ships or manors were awarded through a drawing. This was an early form of a lottery for raising public funds.",
    "historyH2_2": "Medieval Europe and Public Finance",
    "historyP4": "The modern form of the lottery began in 15th-century medieval Europe. Various cities in the Netherlands and Belgium started selling lottery tickets to help the poor or to raise funds for city fortifications.",
    "historyP5": "King Francis I of France introduced the lottery to France after seeing it in Italy, and Queen Elizabeth I of England issued the first national lottery in 1566 to raise money for public works. The proceeds were used for projects such as harbor construction.",
    "historyH2_3": "The Rise and Fall of Lotteries in America",
    "historyP6": "The lottery also played a very important role in the early days of the United States. Many colonial-era universities (such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton) were established with funds raised from lotteries. The Continental Army even financed the Revolutionary War with lottery funds.",
    "historyP7": "However, in the mid-19th century, lotteries were banned in many states due to fraud and corruption scandals. It wasn't until the 20th century that the modern, state-run and regulated form of the lottery began to reappear.",
    "historyH2_4": "The Modern Lottery",
    "historyP8": "Today, the lottery is a major source of government revenue in countless countries around the world and a popular form of entertainment that offers many people the dream of a windfall.",
    "historyP9": "The dream of fortune on a single piece of paper—its history has evolved along with human development.",
    "strategyTitle": "Lottery Number Selection: Is There a Strategy?",
    "strategyP1": "Many people dream of winning first place in the lottery and choose their numbers accordingly. Although it is a completely random game, some people pick their numbers based on their own strategies and patterns. There is no scientific basis for these, but here are a few 'strategies' you can explore for fun.",
    "strategyH2_1": "1. Statistical Approach: Hot and Cold Numbers",
    "strategyP2": "One of the most common approaches is to look at the statistics of past winning numbers.",
    "strategyL1_1": "Hot Numbers: These are numbers that have appeared frequently in recent drawings. People who believe these numbers are on a 'good streak' choose them.",
    "strategyL1_2": "Cold Numbers: These are numbers that have not appeared as winning numbers for a long time. People who believe 'it's their time to come up' choose these numbers.",
    "strategyP3": "Of course, each drawing is an independent event, so past results do not affect the future. However, they can be a good reference for creating your own patterns.",
    "strategyH2_2": "2. Avoiding Combinations and Patterns",
    "strategyP4": "Experts advise avoiding number combinations with specific patterns. For example, consecutive numbers like '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6' or combinations made up of only certain multiples like '7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42' are often chosen by many people. If such a number wins first place, you may have to share the prize money with numerous others.",
    "strategyP5": "Also, for similar reasons, it is best to avoid filling a single line with numbers from the same vertical column or a diagonal line.",
    "strategyH2_3": "3. Treating All Numbers Equally",
    "strategyP6": "The most important thing to remember is that the probability of any number being drawn is the same. The probability of '1' being drawn is the same as '45'. Therefore, instead of sticking to personally significant numbers like birthdays and anniversaries, taking an interest in numbers above 31 can be a way to cover a wider statistical range.",
    "strategyH2_4": "Conclusion",
    "strategyP7": "Ultimately, the lottery is a game of 'luck'. No strategy can guarantee a win. Using a random number generator like the one on our website is one good way to keep all possibilities open. The most important thing is to enjoy the game and purchase lottery tickets responsibly within your means.",
