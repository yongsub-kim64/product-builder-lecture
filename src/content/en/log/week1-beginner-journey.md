## Starting Point: Peak Confusion

**What's a prompt?**

Before Week 1 started, I didn't even know how to ask AI properly. I kept making vague requests like "fix this," and naturally, the results were a mess.

## Week 1 Goals: Working Over Perfect

1. ✅ **Fix Broken Links**: Remove 404 errors
2. ✅ **Mobile Optimization**: Display properly on smartphones
3. ✅ **i18n Support**: Korean/English switching
4. ⏳ **Basic SEO**: Prepare for search visibility

## Learnings

### 1. How to Write Prompts

**Before**: "Fix the link"
**After**: "The link to log/001-rebrand-launch.html returns a 404 error. Please check the current file structure and update to the correct path."

### 2. Git Basics

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Fix broken links"
git push
```

### 3. Debugging Mindset

Error messages are not enemies—they're **hints**.

## Metrics
