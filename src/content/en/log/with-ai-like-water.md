# Embracing AI with the Spirit of Sangseon Yaksu (上善若水)

## Building a Digital Home, Now Opening Its Doors
Over the past five weeks, starting with zero coding knowledge, I completed my digital home, chulbuji.com.
Night after night, I engaged in 'Whispering' with AI, constructing its framework, installing doors, and switching on the lights. Some might dismiss this as "just building a website." However, for me, this experience was more than just acquiring technical skills; it was a confirmation of the possibility that "I can do this too."

## I Am No Philosopher, But I Have AI.
I am neither a master of humanities nor a psychologist.
Yet, I have a Dual Brain — AI — by my side.
The world is changing rapidly, and across borders, countless people speak of loneliness and uncertainty in their own languages. There are those who, lost and adrift, type questions into search engines every day.
I intend to combine AI's vast knowledge with my human 'direction' to present the [AI Personal Insight Report] to the world.
This is not merely the outcome of a cold algorithm.
It is a 'digital prescription' that listens to your complex concerns and offers the warmest humanistic comfort and practical solutions.

## Why Global, Why Monetization?
There is one reason why I am targeting the global market and challenging myself with monetization.

"For those of you who fear change, I want my challenge to serve as a small indicator."

I know the world has changed. But there are those who hesitate to take the first step. I want to tell them: I, an ordinary former semiconductor engineer, will share my journey of collaborating with AI to connect with the world, in real-time and unvarnished.
This is not a success story, but a record of growth.
This is why I created this space.

## Sangseon Yaksu (上善若水) — Like Flowing Water

上善若水 (Sangseon Yaksu): The highest good is like water.
Water benefits all things without contention and flows to the lowest places.

My AI journey aims to be the same.
Instead of striving to conquer technology, I will enjoy riding the currents of change, and in that process, I will not lose my health and laughter. This is not a grand declaration, but just as small, daily currents accumulate to form a river — chulbuji.com is the record of that flow.

Will you join me on my rocket jump?
From thought to structure, from structure to execution.
Tools are byproducts; the record is the protagonist.
