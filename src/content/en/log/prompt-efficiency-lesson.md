## Today's Summary

If I had to sum up today in one sentence: **"The framework is complete, and I found the root cause of the struggle."**

I fully rebuilt chulbuji.com with Astro and released it. However, during the work, my AI usage (5-hour allocation) ran out faster than expected. When I traced the cause, it was surprisingly simple. **The habit of copy-pasting long prompts was burning through tokens.**

## 5 Lessons Learned Today

1. **Copy-paste wasn't a shortcut**: I wanted 'one thing,' but AI processed the pasted conditions as 'ten things.'

2. **Broad role, short instructions**: The more you add "do this, don't do that," the higher the collaboration cost. Keep the goal clear.

3. **Keep sessions short**: Got stuck on lottery ball UI details → session dragged on and ended → consumed with no results. Separate structure sessions from detail sessions.

4. **Limit the scope of changes**: Small change → verify → next change. Seems slower, but overall speed increases.

5. **Manage your usage**: Check remaining usage and allocate 'big tasks/small fixes' accordingly, and strategically use Extra Usage when needed.

## Before / After

**Before**: "Responsive, dark mode, accessibility, SEO, strict TS mode... everything" → Long responses + increased review burden

**After**: "Convert this component to Astro. Responsive only for now." → Quick results + expand in next turn

## What's Left: Update Routine

Once the framework is set up, what remains is 15-minute improvements repeated. Ball shapes, colors, text, content... handle them one by one.

### ✅ 5-Point Checklist

- Before pasting, first write "desired outcome in one sentence"
- One session = one goal (structure OR details)
- Confirm results before next instruction (no rushing)
- Check usage before session and adjust task scope
- Minimize role restrictions, clarify goals only

### ⚡ 3 Actions for Tomorrow (15 min)

1. **(5 min)** Pick one "minimal task to finish in one session" from current project
2. **(5 min)** Reduce frequently used long prompts to "one core sentence"
3. **(5 min)** Bookmark the usage/quota check link

## TL;DR

Copy-pasting was a token-burning habit. **Broad role, short instructions, small sessions.**
