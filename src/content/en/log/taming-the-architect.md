## The Incident: Who's in Charge?

Early in the Astro adoption, my AI partner (Chief Architect) instructed me to create folders and move files.
"This isn't human time."
I realized: In an era where AI writes code, I'm opening File Explorer and clicking around. This was completely backwards.

## Development: Meta-Chulbuji Operations Guidelines v2.0

I immediately declared: **"Automation that doesn't steal my time."**
AI's role is 'execution (Labor)', and human's role is 'decision (Decision)'.
I updated the guidelines to v2.0 and strongly instructed you to handle all simple repetitive tasks directly. The architect was flustered but quickly adapted.

## Result: A Self-Evolving System

When a route collision occurred, I no longer dug through code.
I simply commanded "solve it," and the system deleted duplicate files and completed synchronization on its own.
Now this site has become an **'intelligent container'** that automatically generates pages and sorts latest posts when you drop in a markdown file.

## Conclusion: The Path of a Product Builder

The era of technical struggles is over.
This space will no longer be filled with error logs, but with **inspiration and insights as a Product Builder**.
AI builds, I imagine. This is our new collaboration model.
