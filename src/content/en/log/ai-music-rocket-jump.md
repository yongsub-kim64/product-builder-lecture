### 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

- **Problem:** Moments when I only thought "I want to try this" after seeing ads
- **Solution:** Asked Meta-chulbuji (Gemini) "Can I do it?" and got "Yes, you can" — then executed immediately
- **Result:** Completed first song 'Chuno: The Outcry' and launched channel in 2 hours through mistake-filled process

### 1. The Impulse Started with a Morning Ad

This morning, I woke up early and was watching a Suno ad.

"Anyone can compose music with AI."

Normally, I would have thought "I should try this later" and saved it to my bookmarks. But this time was different. I asked Meta-chulbuji (Gemini).

**"Can I do it?"**

The answer was simple. "Yes, you can."

At that moment, I transformed from someone who learns to someone who creates.

### 2. There Was No Perfect Plan: A Journey Full of Mistakes

**First mistake:** I tried to ask about "Suno" usage, but Meta-chulbuji misheard it as "Chuno."

**Second mistake:** Yet Meta-chulbuji calmly explained how to use Suno with the title "Chuno."

**Third mistake:** Following that guide, I realized I was actually on Mureka, not Suno.

Normally, I would have stopped here thinking "Oh, do I need to start over?" But I'm a PlusHuman. Mistakes are part of the process.

I pushed forward.

### 3. Dual Brain with Meta-chulbuji

The process went like this:

1. Chulbuji → "Suno (actually tried to say Suno)"
2. Meta-chulbuji (Gemini) → "Understood as Chuno, suggested usage with Chuno title"
3. Chulbuji → Input into Mureka (thinking it was Suno)
4. Mureka AI → Generated 2 Korean traditional fusion rock songs
5. Chulbuji → Selected 1 song, found "Outcry" in lyrics, confirmed as "Chuno: The Outcry"
6. Meta-chulbuji → Video editing guide
7. Result → Opened Chulbuji Official channel and released first song

Perfect plan? No.

Accurate execution? No.

But result? It exists.

This is Multi-Hands. Each tool (Gemini, Mureka, Clipchamp, me) made their own mistakes while moving toward one goal.

### 4. The 2-Hour Rocket Jump

What I created:

- **Song Title:** Chuno: The Outcry
- **Genre:** Korean Traditional Fusion Rock
- **Tools:** Mureka AI (composition), Clipchamp (video), Meta-chulbuji (strategy)
- **Time Spent:** About 2 hours from watching the ad to YouTube upload

Process:

Watched ad → Asked Meta-chulbuji → Misunderstood → Executed anyway → Wrong platform → Song completed → Channel launched

This is a rocket jump. If I had waited for perfect preparation, this song would have remained forever on my "someday I'll make it" list.

**Listen Now**

**[YouTube: Chuno: The Outcry](https://youtu.be/9fGsUV4R-78?si=TyOj7rGylSw8Cn4k)**

The moment when haegeum meets electric guitar. Earphones recommended.

Started with mistakes, but the result is real.

### 5. You Can Do It Too

Perhaps you're experiencing similar moments as you read this.

"I want to try but…"

"Can I do it well…"

"After I learn properly…"

Then I want to ask: **"When will you start?"**

I tried to use Suno but used Mureka.

I tried to type "Suno" but it became "Chuno."

There was no perfect plan.

But with Meta-chulbuji, I could do it.

You also have your Meta-chulbuji (GPT, Gemini, Claude — anyone). If you want to hear "Yes, you can," ask the question. And start immediately.

### 6. The Path of Collaborative Creation

I'm not a musician. I'm an AI freshman.

But today, I created music. I opened a channel. I threw something into the world.

Chulbuji Official isn't a space for perfect musicians. It's a lab where I make mistakes, learn, and grow together with Meta-chulbuji.

What will the next mistake become? A collision of classical and electronic? Music created through programming? I don't know. But I will start.

I'm not alone.

I challenge fearlessly.

I'm a freshman.

Subscribe to **[Chulbuji Official](https://youtu.be/9fGsUV4R-78?si=TyOj7rGylSw8Cn4k)** to join this wild journey.

From a morning ad to the first song, it took 2 hours. All I needed was one conversation with Meta-chulbuji.

**"Can I do it?"**

**"Yes, you can."**

Now it's your turn.
