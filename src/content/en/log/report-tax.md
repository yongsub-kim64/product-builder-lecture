"If I win 2 billion KRW, how much will I actually receive?" Lottery prize money is classified as 'other income' under income tax law and is paid after withholding tax at determined rates.

## Tax Basis and Tax Rate Brackets

The tax standard for lottery prize money is specified in **Income Tax Act Article 21 (Other Income)**.

- **50,000 KRW or less**: Tax-free
- **Over 50,000 KRW ~ up to 300 million KRW**: 22% (income tax 20% + local income tax 2%)
- **Amount exceeding 300 million KRW**: 33% (income tax 30% + local income tax 3%)

The most important point is that the high tax rate of 33% is applied only to the **'amount exceeding 300 million KRW'**.
