Just two songs, but I built a house.
I promoted it with just two songs. Strangely, rather than feeling embarrassed, I felt alive.
It would be a lie to say I didn't feel embarrassed spreading the link everywhere. There was definitely an inner voice saying, 'What kind of channel is this with only two songs?' But surprisingly, a stronger feeling came over me than embarrassment. The feeling that something actually exists. The fact that what I created was out there somewhere in the world was much more powerful fuel than I thought.
I felt that the content was lacking, but that feeling pushed me to the next experiment. I now know that I'm the type of person who can never start if I wait for perfection.

### First attempt: Import, and just upload
When I first encountered Mureka, I was honestly a consumer.
There was AI-generated music and images. I took them and stitched them together with Clipchamp. At first, even that simple task was daunting. I kept getting stuck and wondering, "Is this right?" I didn't know that so many decisions were needed to upload a single video. Thumbnail ratio, subtitle position, background volume. They seem trivial, but for a beginner, each one was a hurdle.
But I uploaded it. And after uploading, I knew. What I learned at this stage was not technology. "The ability to put the results given by AI out into the world," that was the first lesson. It may seem like a stuffed specimen, but you have to at least try to stuff it to see what's next.

### Second attempt: Interpret, and direct
The second song was different. I made the music with Suno, and this time I discussed the lyrics with Gemini.
It may sound grand to call it a discussion, but it was actually like this. "I think these lyrics are too direct, can you change them to leave a little more lingering imagery?" When the AI suggested alternatives, I reacted again. Then, at some point, I felt that I was not just receiving the results, but playing a role in giving them meaning.
And I created 7 images to match the lyrics.
It was different from the first time when I uploaded a single static image. The 7 images had an order. There was a flow. At first, I was just thinking, "Let's make a lot," but as I made them, the images started to talk to each other. A structure with an introduction, a transition, and a conclusion. At that moment, something clicked into place.
Ah, this is directing.
From a single static image to a 7-part narrative. From assembly to directing. That's the distance I've traveled in my freshman year.

### The sophomore declaration is not an ambition, but an action
I was a freshman in the AI civilization. Today, I'm moving up to sophomore year.
The sophomore year's goals don't have to be big. Deeper collaboration, repetition of smaller experiments. The next song, the next video comes before a grand plan. The important thing is that I released it even with only two songs, and because I released it, there was a reaction, and because there was a reaction, I could update it.
Update over perfection. Release → Reaction → Update. I will continue this loop.
The house is still small. But I built the house.

The [Chulbuji Official](https://www.youtube.com/@ChulbujiOfficial/featured) channel started like that. With just two songs.
