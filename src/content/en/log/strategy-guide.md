Many people dream of lottery 1st prize while selecting numbers. Though it's a completely random game, some people have their own strategies and patterns for choosing numbers.

## Premise: All Numbers Have Equal Probability

Lottery is a completely random game. No matter which numbers you select, the probability of winning is equally 1 in 8,145,060.

## Nevertheless: Expected Prize Money Strategy

While you can't change winning **probability**, the **prize money** you receive when you win can differ.

### 1. Avoid Popular Numbers

If you avoid numbers many people select, when you win, you can take more money alone or share it with fewer people.

**Patterns to Avoid**:
- Birthday combinations (concentrated in 1~31 range)
- Drawing pictures on ticket (horizontal/vertical/diagonal)
- Evenly spaced numbers (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
- Consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

### 2. Stick to Your Own Numbers

- Consistently purchasing your own numbers is more psychologically stable than selecting different numbers each time.
- However, this doesn't increase winning probability.

### 3. Auto vs Manual

- **Auto**: Generated completely randomly, high possibility of avoiding popular numbers.
- **Manual**: High psychological satisfaction from being able to select your own meaningful numbers.

## Enjoying Lottery Wisely

1. **Set Budget**: Purchase only a fixed amount each week
2. **Enjoy as Entertainment**: Approach as a hobby, not investment
3. **Post-Winning Plan**: Having a plan in advance allows you to make wise decisions when actually winning.

## Conclusion

There's no perfect strategy for lottery. However, if you avoid popular numbers and approach it with an attitude of healthy enjoyment, lottery can become reasonable entertainment that brings small joy to daily life.
