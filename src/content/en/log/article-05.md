"The combination of 3 odd and 3 even numbers comes out most often," "You should avoid consecutive numbers" — 'pattern analysis' you've probably heard at least once when selecting lottery numbers. Do these patterns actually have a real impact on winning probability?

## Core Premise: All Combinations Have Equal Probability

All possible number combinations in Lotto 6/45 (total of 8,145,060 combinations) have mathematically **equal** probability of appearing.

In other words, the probability of the extreme consecutive number combination '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6' appearing is exactly 1 in 8,145,060, the same as the so-called 'golden ratio' combination.

## Fact-Checking Representative Pattern Analysis

### 1. Odd and Even Number Ratio (Odd-Even Pattern)

This is the most frequently mentioned pattern. Usually, combinations of '3 odd : 3 even' or '4 odd : 2 even' are said to be ideal.

- **Number of Cases**: Among 45 numbers, there are 23 odd numbers and 22 even numbers. Probabilistically, combinations at the midpoint have far more cases than extreme combinations.
- **The Trap**: It's that there are many 'variations' of combinations corresponding to '3 odd : 3 even,' not that the 'winning probability' of each of those combinations is higher.

### 2. Consecutive Numbers (Consecutive Digits)

There's a saying that "consecutive numbers don't come out often" or "it's good to include only about one pair of consecutive numbers."

Looking at past data, there are actually more draws that include one or more pairs of consecutive numbers than draws without consecutive numbers. This can be explained mathematically as well.

### 3. Number Sum (Total)

There's also analysis that winning probability is high when the sum of 6 numbers is within a specific range (usually between 100~170). This is also a trap of the number of cases.

## When Pattern Analysis Is the Only Time It Has Meaning

"Choosing patterns that others don't select is the only strategy to receive more prize money if you win."

Most people tend to prefer specific patterns according to their intuition. Just by avoiding these popular patterns, you can reduce the number of people to share the prize money with if you win first place.

## Conclusion: Patterns Are a Reflection of Psychology, Not a Prediction Tool

Lottery pattern analysis is closer to a mirror showing the psychological tendencies of people selecting numbers, rather than a science predicting the future.

Rather than spending time on pattern analysis, it may be a wiser approach to recognize that all combinations have equal probability and consistently purchase 'your own numbers' that other people wouldn't prefer.
