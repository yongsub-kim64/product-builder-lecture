## From Lottery to Records

This site originally started as a simple lottery number generator. It was a small experiment, but a bigger picture began to emerge.

Creating just tools is fun but felt hollow. I realized that the real value lies in **documenting the process**, **organizing thoughts**, and **sharing learnings**.

## New Direction

Now chulbuji is:
- **Record-centric**: Tools are byproducts, records are protagonists
- **AI Collaboration**: The process of transforming thoughts into code
- **Transparent Learning**: Sharing both failures and successes

## Next Steps

1. Build blogging system
2. Keep existing lottery tool (as learning example)
3. Add new projects

The journey has begun.
