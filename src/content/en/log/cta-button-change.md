### 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

- **Problem:** Visitors were averaging nearly 2 minutes on the page, but zero CTA button clicks
- **Hypothesis:** "Start for Free" created psychological friction and uncertainty about what comes next
- **Action:** Changed the button copy to "Organize My Thoughts for Free" — data will tell us if we're right

### 1. Spotting the Problem (Data)

Looking at data from about 100 recent visitors, people were spending nearly **2 minutes on average** carefully reading through the landing page.

But there were **zero clicks**.

They're reading. But no one is pressing the button.

The numbers were speaking: "Something's wrong with this page."

### 2. Forming a Hypothesis

Why weren't people clicking?

The most prominent button said **"Start for Free"** — but I concluded that visitors were hesitating because clicking it felt like it would lead to something complicated: **psychological friction** and **uncertainty about the outcome**.

Even with "free" right there, the word "start" feels heavy somehow.

> *"Wait, does clicking this mean I'm signing up for something?"*
> *"Start what exactly? Do I have to do something?"*

The moment a question mark appears in a visitor's head, their finger stops.

### 3. What We Did (Action)

Instead of rebuilding the whole system, we edited the **smallest unit of customer contact: the CTA copy**.

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Before** | Start for Free |
| **After** | Organize My Thoughts for Free |

Just a few words of difference. But the message is completely different.

- **"Start"** → Feels like a commitment, heavy
- **"Organize My Thoughts"** → A light action you can just try, with clear value

The hypothesis is simple: **if you can feel what you'll get right from the button, you'll click it.**

### 4. The Next Step

We don't know yet if this change is the right answer.

But it's the best we can do right now. As data accumulates, it will be validated.

Our service isn't an AI that gives you answers. It's a tool that **structures your cluttered thoughts in 1 minute**.
