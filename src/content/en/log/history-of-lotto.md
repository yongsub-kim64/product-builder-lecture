Though it appears to be a simple numbers game, lottery has a long tradition accompanying human history. The origin of lottery dates back to ancient civilizations.

## Ancient Rome and China's Early Forms

The first records of lottery-like forms can be found in ancient China's Han Dynasty. Around 200 BC, a drawing-type lottery similar to Keno was issued to raise funds for major national projects (e.g., Great Wall construction).

In ancient Rome, Roman Empire emperors used to distribute a kind of prize ticket called 'apophoreta' to guests at banquets. Wealthy citizens would donate funds, and large prizes like ships or mansions were given through drawings. This was an early form of lottery to collect funds for public works.

## Medieval Europe and Public Finance

Lottery in its modern form began in 15th century medieval Europe. Several cities in the Netherlands and Belgium started selling lottery tickets to help poor people or raise funds to build city defense facilities.

France's Francis I saw lottery in Italy and introduced it to France, and England's Queen Elizabeth I also issued the first state lottery in 1566 to raise funds for public works. The proceeds from this lottery were used for projects such as port construction.

## America and the Rise and Fall of Lottery

Lottery also played a very important role in early America. Many universities in colonial times (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.) raised establishment funds through lottery issuance. The Continental Army also funded the War of Independence through lottery.

However, in the mid-19th century, lottery was banned in many states due to fraud and corruption scandals. Only in the 20th century did modern forms of lottery directly operated and regulated by government begin to reappear.

## Modern Lottery

Today, lottery has established itself as an important government revenue source in numerous countries worldwide and as popular entertainment culture that plants dreams of sudden wealth in many people. With technological advancement, participation through online purchase and mobile apps has also become possible.

The dream of luck contained in a single sheet of paper — its history has accompanied human development like this.
