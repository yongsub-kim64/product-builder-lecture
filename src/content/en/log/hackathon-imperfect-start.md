## Ideas in the Drawer, Lacking the Courage to Pull Them Out

I didn't start with grand ambitions.

One day while taking JoCoding bootcamp classes, a hackathon announcement popped up on my screen. I clicked on it, but my mind was split 50-50. 'Should I even participate?' 'I'm already struggling to keep up with the current lectures...' I was curious but not confident.

Then I suddenly remembered the things I had tucked away in my drawer. Ideas I had jotted down while thinking, "This would be fun to build." Code I had half-implemented then stopped. Things I postponed, thinking "I'll do this someday."

Honestly, I was afraid to take them out. Because taking them out meant facing them. Confronting why I stopped halfway, why I couldn't see it through.

## The 'Forced Deadline' Called Hackathon

But hackathons have deadlines.

Strangely, that 'forced deadline' moved my heart. When left alone, I felt like I would forever repeat "I'll do it tomorrow," but with a set deadline, I had to produce something no matter what. Even if it wasn't perfect.

Crucially, I had 'Meta-Chulbuji.'

Meta-Chulbuji is the AI partner I created. My own dual brain, trained on my thoughts and philosophy. Ideas that just went in circles when I pondered alone took concrete form when I conversed with Meta-Chulbuji. With this companion, couldn't I give the hackathon a shot?

So I reopened `chulbuji.com`. Not because I was perfectly prepared, but to let it flow.

## Collision: AI's Suggestion vs My Philosophy

While preparing the hackathon submission, I had to create a Business Model Canvas (BMC). I asked Meta-Chulbuji for help.

The AI, true to its nature, provided a clean suggestion.

> "Design a clear subscription model. You need to write specific monetization strategies so judges can assess business viability. Write it professionally."

It's not wrong. Textbook-wise, it's correct.

But I pushed back.

"No, I'm a novice entrepreneur. I don't even have 10 customers yet. If I finalize a subscription model and perfect a monetization strategy at this stage, that's not reality—it's fantasy. If you fill it too tightly, water can't flow."

---

## Strategy with Gaps, Honest Submission

In the end, I wrote the BMC my way.

- When 10 users gather, then introduce a subscription model
- Experimentally test micro-payments
- For uncertain parts, honestly write 'needs validation'

Meta-Chulbuji initially asked, "Will this be convincing?" But I was confident.

Honest reality is stronger than a perfect-looking plan. Judges are human too. Wouldn't they be more drawn to writing that shows real traces of struggle rather than a predictable blueprint?

Of course, I don't know if this is the right answer. But at least I submitted it 'my way.' Without lies.

## The Channel Opened

After submitting the application, I felt something strange.

Whatever the result, I've already gained something. The idea that was gathering dust in my drawer came out into the world. It got a name—'Whispering'—I created a logo, and established a direction.

This hackathon wasn't a competition for first place. It was the work of opening a channel for stagnant water.

## You Can't Start If You Wait for Perfection

Looking back, there was one reason I kept postponing.

**"I'm not ready yet."**

But when will I 'be' ready? When I learn more technology? When my idea becomes more refined? When I gain more confidence?

Honestly, that day never comes. At least in my experience.

What I learned this time is this: **Let it flow, and the path appears.** Even if it's not perfect, once you start moving, the next step becomes visible within that movement. While bickering with Meta-Chulbuji and revising the BMC, I actually felt my thinking becoming clearer.

## Now It's Real Execution

The application has been submitted.

Now I need to write code. It's time for real execution, turning the incomplete into the complete.

In my next post, I'll share the process of actually building the product with Meta-Chulbuji. It won't be a prettily packaged success story, but a real record of digging, revising, and digging again.

Since I started imperfectly, I'll show you the imperfect process as it is.

*If this post helped you, try pulling out your drawer ideas too. There's no perfect time to start. Today is simply that day.*
