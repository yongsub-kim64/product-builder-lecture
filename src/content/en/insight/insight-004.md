I can't say I wrote code today. I asked questions.

Four hours later, Tetris was live at [chulbuji.com/playground](https://chulbuji.com/playground). BGM composed by Suno. Thumbnail generated by AI. I set the direction — Claude Code moved the hands.

> A first-year AI builder doesn't need finished code. They need the right questions to find the direction.

## The Z Fold Bug — and 10 Minutes

Right before shipping, I tested on a Z Fold. The moment I unfolded the phone, every touch button disappeared.

Turns out the wider screen was being read as desktop. Desktop means keyboard control, so the system hid the touch buttons. Technically correct logic. But for me, it was a bug.

I asked this:

> "Change the touch detection to use pointer: coarse instead of screen width."

Instead of checking screen size, it would detect whether the device actually uses touch input. I didn't know this concept. The AI found the fix. Done in 10 minutes.

## What the Human Did. What the AI Did.

**Human (chulbuji):**
1. Set the direction — "Tetris, mobile touch included"
2. Found the bug — tested personally on Z Fold
3. Designed the question — described the symptom, asked for the fix
4. Made the call to ship — even without perfection

**AI (Claude Code + Suno + image generation):**
1. The entire game codebase
2. Touch button logic
3. BGM composition
4. Thumbnail image
5. `pointer: coarse` bug fix

## Ship First

It's not perfect, honestly. There may be more bugs.

I shipped it anyway. You need to go public to get feedback. You need feedback to build the next version. Nothing is built perfectly in isolation — especially not in your first year.

Tomorrow I'll try adding one thing: a score tracker. I'll ask Claude Code about that too.

Still a first year. I don't know code. So I'm learning to ask better questions. Here's what today taught me: **the question comes before the code.**
