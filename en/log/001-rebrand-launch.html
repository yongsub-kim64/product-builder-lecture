           <h2>34 Years in Semiconductors, and My Very First Website</h2>
           <p>
             For 34 years, I've worked in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Power semiconductor fabrication, specifically, has been my area of expertise. I've spent decades handling what happens on silicon wafers — but building a website was an entirely different world.
           </p>
           <p>
             Yet here I am, having built my very first website. I applied what I learned from a "Vibe Coding 5-Week Bootcamp," setting up a deployment pipeline connecting Firebase Studio + CLI, GitHub, and Cloudflare Pages. The feeling when I first deployed it was still vivid — similar to the thrill of seeing the first wafer come out of a new process line.
           </p>
           <p>
             That first creation was a <strong>Lotto Number Generator</strong>. A simple page built with just HTML and CSS. Nothing technically impressive, but the fact that I'd made something with my own hands and put it on the internet was meaningful in itself. This was the beginning of chulbuji.com.
           </p>

           <h2>Why I Had to Move Beyond the Lotto Generator</h2>
           <p>
             The Lotto Number Generator was a good first experiment. But within days, I realized something. Could this site help me grow? Could it give visitors a reason to come back?
           </p>
           <p>
             The honest answer was "no."
           </p>
           <p>
             A lotto generator is a one-time-use tool. There was no space for my thoughts, no structure to record what I was learning. Most importantly, it couldn't contain the massive transition I was going through — from a semiconductor engineer to a new kind of being who collaborates with AI.
           </p>
           <p>
             What I needed was <strong>a space to record</strong>. A place to experiment, fail, and stack up lessons learned. Not a lotto generator, but a hub to track my own transformation.
           </p>

           <h2>The Arrival of AI Civilization, and Choosing to Be a PlusHuman</h2>
           <p>
             Why would someone who's made semiconductors for 34 years suddenly talk about AI?
           </p>
           <p>
             The answer is simple. <strong>AI civilization has already arrived.</strong> If semiconductors are AI's physical foundation, I wanted to understand the world of intelligence running on top of them. I wanted to take the hands that built hardware and start working with software and AI.
           </p>
           <p>
             Through this journey, I encountered the concept of <strong>PlusHuman (+Human)</strong>. PlusHuman pursues <strong>Total Intelligence</strong> — the fusion of Human Intelligence (HI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's not about seeing AI as just a tool, but about learning to think together and operate together with AI.
           </p>
           <p>
             PlusHuman has three founding principles:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
             <p><strong>1. I am not alone.</strong> AI is my partner. I'm not ashamed of what I don't know.</p>
             <p><strong>2. I challenge without fear.</strong> Whether you have 34 years of experience or one, everyone is a beginner in a new domain.</p>
             <p><strong>3. I am a first-grader.</strong> There is no graduation from learning. Every day is day one.</p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
             These principles gave me courage. Instead of hiding behind the title of "semiconductor expert," I chose to become a "first-grader" in front of AI.
           </p>

           <h2>The Birth of Meta-chulbuji: My AI Persona</h2>
           <p>
             "Chulbuji" was originally just my nickname. But as I learned the PlusHuman way of operating, it took on a meaning far beyond that.
           </p>
           <p>
             <strong>Chulbuji</strong> is the human me. The one with 34 years of semiconductor experience, field intuition, and judgment.
           </p>
           <p>
             <strong>Meta-chulbuji</strong> is my AI persona. The AI partner that structures Chulbuji's thoughts, searches for knowledge, and finds patterns.
           </p>
           <p>
             Together, they form the <strong>Dual Brain</strong> system.
           </p>
           <table>
             <thead>
               <tr>
                 <th>Role</th>
                 <th>Chulbuji (Human Brain)</th>
                 <th>Meta-chulbuji (AI Brain)</th>
               </tr>
             </thead>
             <tbody>
               <tr>
                 <td>Strengths</td>
                 <td>34 years of field experience, intuition, contextual understanding</td>
                 <td>Fast search, structuring, pattern recognition</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>Weaknesses</td>
                 <td>Coding beginner, limited information processing speed</td>
                 <td>No field experience, lacks context</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>Function</td>
                 <td>Sets direction and makes judgments</td>
                 <td>Assists execution and builds structure</td>
               </tr>
             </tbody>
           </table>
           <p>
             This Dual Brain operates through <strong>Whispering</strong> — conversing with AI in a whisper-like dialogue to organize your thoughts. You throw a hazy idea at AI, AI gives it structure, then you judge and refine it. Through this iterative process, you reach results that would be difficult to achieve alone.
           </p>

           <h2>The Second Experiment: AI Personal Insight Report</h2>
           <p>
             The second experiment was an evolution. <strong>AI Personal Insight Report</strong> — a project built with React and Vite in Firebase Studio.
           </p>
           <p>
             If the first experiment was a static page made with HTML/CSS alone, the second introduced the React framework and is being developed with actual monetization as a goal. What I confirmed through this process: <strong>By orchestrating specialist AIs, you can build real products even with limited coding experience.</strong>
           </p>

           <h2>The Decision to Rebrand: From Tool to Recording Space</h2>
           <p>
             All these experiences converged into the decision to rebrand:
           </p>
           <p>
             Lotto Number Generator (First Experiment) → "This isn't a vessel that can contain me" → Discovered PlusHuman · Dual Brain · Whispering → AI Personal Insight Report (Second Experiment) → "I need to record and brand this entire process" → chulbuji.com → Rebranded as a Recording Hub
           </p>
           <p>
             The new direction for chulbuji.com is clear:
           </p>
           <p>
             <strong>"A space where a 34-year semiconductor veteran records the entire journey of growing into an AI Product Builder, together with AI."</strong>
           </p>
           <p>
             The tools are <strong>byproducts</strong>. The real protagonist is <strong>the record itself</strong>.
           </p>

           <table>
             <thead>

           <h2>In Closing: What "Chulbuji" Means</h2>
           <p>
             <strong>Chulbuji means "someone who doesn't know yet."</strong> Even with 34 years of experience, I'm a chulbuji in front of AI. And that's a good thing. Not knowing means you can learn, and learning means you can grow.
           </p>
           <p>
             This site is where Chulbuji records the journey of turning the unknown into the known, together with Meta-chulbuji. Thoughts into structure, structure into execution.
